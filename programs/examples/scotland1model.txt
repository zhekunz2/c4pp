			# The vector C[] required as input into the car.proper distribution is a vector
			# respresention of the weight matrix with elements Cij. The first J1 elements of the C[]
			# vector contain the weights for the J1 neighbours of area i=1; the (J1+1) to J2
			# elements of the C[] vector contain the weights for the J2 neighbours of area i=2;
			# etc. To set up this vector, we need to define a variable cumsum, which gives the
			# values of J1, J2, etc.; we then set up an index matrix pick[,] with N columns
			#  corresponding to the  i=1,...,N areas, and with the same number of rows as there are
			# elements in the C[] vector (i.e. sumNumNeigh). The elements 
			#C[ (cumsum[i]+1):cumsum[i+1] ] correspond to 
			# the set of weights Cij associated with area i, and so we set up ith column of the
			# matrix pick[,]to have a 1 in all the rows k for which 
			#cumsum[i] < k <= cumsum[i+1], and 0's elsewhere. 
			# For example, let N=4 and cumsum=c(0,3,5,6,8), so area i=1 has 3 neighbours, area
			# i=2 has 2 neighbours, area i=3 has 1 neighbour and area i=4 has 2 neighbours. The
			# the matrix pick[,] is:
			#                pick                  
			#             1, 0, 0, 0,                   
			#             1, 0, 0, 0,                   
			#             1, 0, 0, 0,                    
			#             0, 1, 0, 0,                   
			#             0, 1, 0, 0,                   
			#             0, 0, 1, 0,                   
			#             0, 0, 0, 1,                   
			#             0, 0, 0, 1,                   
			#
			# We can then use the inner product (inprod(,)) function in WinBUGS and the kth
			# row of pick to select which area corresponds to the kth element in the vector C[];
			# likewise, we can use inprod(,) 
			# and the ith column of pick to select the elements of C[] which correspond to area i.
			#
			# Note: this way of setting up the C vector is somewhat convoluted!!!! In future
			# versions, we hope the GeoBUGS adjacency matrix tool will be able to dump out the
			# relevant  vectors required. Alternatively, the C vector could be created using another
			# package (e.g. Splus) and read into WinBUGS as data.
