# Inference for Stan model: gp_simple_latent_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (1.8, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6) seconds, 6.5 seconds total
# Sampling took (1.2, 1.1, 1.1, 1.3) seconds, 4.7 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
