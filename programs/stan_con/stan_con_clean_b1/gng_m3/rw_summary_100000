# Inference for Stan model: gng_m3_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(100000); warmup=(1000); thin=(1); 101000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (29) seconds, 29 seconds total
# Sampling took (2463) seconds, 41 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
