# Inference for Stan model: cra_exp_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(100000); warmup=(1000); thin=(1); 101000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (9.5) seconds, 9.5 seconds total
# Sampling took (625) seconds, 10 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
