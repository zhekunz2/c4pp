# Inference for Stan model: cra_exp_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (10, 9.8, 8.6, 9.6) seconds, 38 seconds total
# Sampling took (6.3, 6.1, 5.9, 6.6) seconds, 25 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
