# Inference for Stan model: bandit4arm_lapse_decay_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (55, 48, 53, 49) seconds, 3.4 seconds total
# Sampling took (49, 50, 49, 45) seconds, 3.2 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
