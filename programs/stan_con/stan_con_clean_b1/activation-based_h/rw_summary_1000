# Inference for Stan model: activation_based_h_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,975,992); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 7967 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (1644, 1726, 0.00, 0.00) seconds, 56 seconds total
# Sampling took (856, 923, 0.00, 0.00) seconds, 30 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
