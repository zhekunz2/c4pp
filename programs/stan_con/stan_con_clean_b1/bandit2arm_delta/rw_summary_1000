# Inference for Stan model: bandit2arm_delta_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (11, 11, 11, 11) seconds, 45 seconds total
# Sampling took (12, 6.8, 7.2, 12) seconds, 37 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
