# Inference for Stan model: gng_m2_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(100); warmup=(1000); thin=(1); 1100 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (21) seconds, 21 seconds total
# Sampling took (2.1) seconds, 2.1 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
