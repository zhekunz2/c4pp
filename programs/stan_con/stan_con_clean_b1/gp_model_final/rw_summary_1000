# Inference for Stan model: gp_model_final_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (5.9, 6.1, 5.7, 6.3) seconds, 24 seconds total
# Sampling took (2.2, 2.2, 2.1, 2.2) seconds, 8.7 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
