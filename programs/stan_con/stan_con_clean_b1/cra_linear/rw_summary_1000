# Inference for Stan model: cra_linear_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (8.1, 8.5, 8.0, 8.2) seconds, 33 seconds total
# Sampling took (5.1, 5.4, 5.0, 5.2) seconds, 21 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
