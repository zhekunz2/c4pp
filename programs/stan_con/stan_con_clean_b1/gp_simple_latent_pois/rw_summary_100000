# Inference for Stan model: gp_simple_latent_pois_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(100000); warmup=(1000); thin=(1); 101000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (1.2) seconds, 1.2 seconds total
# Sampling took (104) seconds, 1.7 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
