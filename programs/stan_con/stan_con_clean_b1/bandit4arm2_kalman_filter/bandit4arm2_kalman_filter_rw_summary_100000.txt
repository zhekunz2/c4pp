# Inference for Stan model: bandit4arm2_kalman_filter_model
# 1 chains: each with iter=(27666); warmup=(1000); thin=(1); 28666 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (0.00) seconds, 0.00 seconds total
# Sampling took (0.00) seconds, 0.00 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
