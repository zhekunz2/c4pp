# Inference for Stan model: bandit4arm2_kalman_filter_model
# 4 chains: each with iter=(1000,1000,1000,1000); warmup=(1000,1000,1000,1000); thin=(1,1,1,1); 8000 iterations saved.
#
# Warmup took (202, 212, 182, 177) seconds, 13 seconds total
# Sampling took (129, 129, 126, 128) seconds, 8.5 seconds total
#
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
