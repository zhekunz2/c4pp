1. SATzilla: Portfolio-based Algorithm Selection for SAT

they use log of runtimes.. we can use log of data_size?

do feature selection (forward selection)

censored data(timed out cases)

hierarchical models: check convergence, then accuracy?

add details of timeouts (total, average) for feature computation and metric computation

ground truth of mutants, how many converged/have accurate results?

predictor for all models combined, extend to another unseen set of models?

2. Performance Prediction and Automated Tuning of Randomized and Parametric Algorithms

predict the parameters of runtime distribution

predicting initial values of parameters

3. https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/weakly_informative_shapes.html

Weakly informative priors are especially critical when inferences are hindered with only weakly identifiable likelihoods, such as those arising from models with sparse data.

#Check for data sparsity/density! in Observed data variable/Input data Variable
